## Minimum template requirements

Let's discuss the minimum components your template requires: `template` directory and `package.json` file.

## 1. `template` directory

The `template` directory stores generated outputs in files. In other words, the generator processes all the files stored in this directory.

```js
import { File, Text } from "@asyncapi/generator-react-sdk";

export default function({ asyncapi, params, originalAsyncAPI }) {
return (
    <File name="asyncapi.md">
    <Text>This is a markdown file for my application.</Text>
    <Text>App name is: **{ asyncapi.info().title() }**</Text>
    </File>
);
}
```
## 2. `package.json` file

Before the generation process runs, the generator installs the template into its dependencies. A `package.json` is necessary to identify the template name.

The following block shows an example `package.json` file that points to the [React Render Engine](react-render-engine.md) and necessary dependencies:

```json
{
  "name": "myTemplate",
  "generator": {
    "renderer": "react"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "@asyncapi/generator-react-sdk": "^0.2.25"
  }
}
```

The above example of a`template/index.js` file shows the generation process result. The user also receives an `asyncapi.md` file with hardcoded and dynamic (title of the application taken from AsyncAPI document) information.

Every template must depend on the [`@asyncapi/generator-react-sdk` package](https://github.com/asyncapi/generator-react-sdk), which contains a template file's basic components.

## Additional configuration options

You must configure the generator's `package.json` file to contain JSON objects with the required parameters for template configuration, such as:

|Name|Type|Description|
|---|---|---|
|`renderer`| String | Its value can be either `react` or `nunjucks` (default).
|`supportedProtocols`| [String] | A list with all the protocols this template supports.
|`parameters`| Object[String, Object] | An object with all the parameters that can be passed when generating the template. When using the command line, it's done by indicating `--param name=value` or `-p name=value`.
|`parameters[param].description`| String | A user-friendly description about the parameter.
|`parameters[param].default`| Any | Default value of the parameter if not specified. Shouldn't be used for mandatory `required=true` parameters.
|`parameters[param].required`| Boolean | Whether the parameter is required or not.

These are predefined configurations which help generator achieve specific set of tasks throughout the generation process. The `generator` property from 'package.json' contains all the configuration information. To learn more about template configuration and various supported parameters. Read more about the [configuration file](configuration-file.md).

> Whenever you make a change to the package.json, make sure you perform an update by running `npm install`;  this command synchronizes with the package-lock.json and validates the file.

The following examples show some advanced configurations we can use in our `package.json` file:

```json
{
  "name": "myTemplate",
  "generator": {
    "renderer": "react",
    "supportedProtocols": "mqtt"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "@asyncapi/generator-react-sdk": "^0.2.25"
  }
}
```
Based on these custom configurations we can use this template to generate output. The above `package.json` file has a newly added configuration called `supportedProtocols` which is set to `mqtt`. This configuration displays all the protocols that this template supports. We can have multiple supported protocols in our template. 

For example, if you want to generate an output using above template, you need to have asyncapi document that has servers with `mqtt` in order to generate your desired output. If your asyncapi document has server connections with `kafka`, the generation process will be halted since the only supported protocol mentioned is `mqtt`. 

Additionally, we can also have configuration called as `parameters` which is an object with all the parameters that can be passed when generating the template. When using the command line, it's done by indicating `--param name=value` or `-p name=value`:

```json
{
  "name": "myTemplate",
  "generator": {
    "renderer": "react",
    "supportedProtocols": "mqtt",
    "parameters": {
        "version": {
          "description": "Override the version of your application provided under `info.version` location in the specification file.",
          "required": false
        }
    }
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "@asyncapi/generator-react-sdk": "^0.2.25"
  }
}
```

The default version of your application is always fetched from your asyncapi document. The above configuration will help template user to override the existing version with a new version on the command line. For example, `-p version=2.0.0`.

The changes done in the template will be as follows:

Original:

```js
<Text>App name is: **{ asyncapi.info().title() }**</Text>
```

Newer:

```js
<Text>App name is: **{ asyncapi.info().title() }**</Text>
<Text>Version is: **{params.version || asyncapi.info.version()}**</Text>
```

## Hooks

[Hooks](hooks.md) enable templates to perform multiple tasks. You can add Hooks to your template as fractions of code. In the template, you must store it in the `hooks` directory under the template directory. You can also store it in other modules and external libraries, or even configure it inside the template. The generation process can perform multiple actions. _(Example: A hook that generates a pdf after the generation process is complete.)_

**Templates** can perform multiple actions _before_ or _after_ the generation process with the help of **hooks**.

For example, In AsyncAPI html-template, hooks can help you change the specification version with the new `version` that you can pass before the generation process even begins:

```js
module.exports = {
  'generate:before': ({ asyncapi, templateParams = {} }) => {
    const version = templateParams.version || asyncapi.info().version();
    asyncapi._json.info.version = version;
  }
};
```
This can be an even better alternative way of overriding the `version` parameter that we discussed in the previous section. If the user executes the command â€˜-p version=2.0.0 asyncapiFileDir="./"` on the command line, the asyncapi file along with the overwritten version will be returned in the form of a pdf or markdown document. 

The updated template looks like the following:

```js
<Text>App name is: **{ asyncapi.info().title() }**</Text>
<Text>Version is: **{asyncapi.info.version()}**</Text>
```

Since hooks are reusable, it is very important that you override the version in the template context as well. For example, In nodejs-template, the following hooks are overridden in the template context so that they can still be reused for other purposes:

```json
{
"@asyncapi/generator-hooks": "^0.1.0",
"hooks": {
      "@asyncapi/generator-hooks": "createAsyncapiFile"
    }
  }
```
