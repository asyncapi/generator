## Overview

### What is a Generator Tool, anyway?

AsyncAPI generator is a tool that you can use to generate whatever you want based on the AsyncAPI specification file as an input. The Generator is our solution to automatically generate documentation and code from your AsyncAPI files

To specify what exactly must be generated you create a generator template. Generator knows what to generate because you supplement it with a generator template. The template is a project where you provide all the files that must be generated using available generator features. To create your own template, go to section that explains [How to create a template](https://github.com/pratik2315/generator/blob/gsod1-pratik/docs/tutorials/how-to-create-a-template.md).

The generator tool comes with lots of cool features and services you can't miss. Some of them are:
- HTML & Markdown : Generate beautiful HTML documentation that's easy to share with your team and customers. Markdown docs that will seat along with your code? Perfect!

- Node.js, Java, Python : Generate code out of your AsyncAPI files in your favourite programming language. Speed up the time-to-first-prototype. Keep using it even after you write your custom business logic.

- Highly extensible : Don't see your programming language of choice? Want to generate docs that meet your brand look and feel? Create your custom templates or extend existing ones.

If your purpose is to automate the code and documentation generation process, the Generator tool might be the perfect solution for you! There are a large number of templates that are ready to use and are officially supported by the AsyncAPI Initiative. To see them, go to the section [List of official generator templates]() provided by AsyncAPI initiative.
