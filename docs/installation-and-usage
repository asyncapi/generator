## AsyncAPI CLI Installation
This is a guide to show you how to set up your local developer environment to start using the AsyncAPI CLI to generate boilerplate code and documentation for your message-driven APIs.

### Pre-installation
To run the AsyncAPI CLI, you'll need to have installed:
1. Node.js v12.16 and higher
2. npm v6.13.7 and higher
   
To verify the versions of Node and Npm you have, run the commands below on your terminal:
```
npm -v
```
```
node -v
```

If you have the right versions installed in your laptop, you can proceed to the CLI installation guide below else, kindly upgrade the versions of your npm or node if lower than the versions listed above.

>:bulb: **Remember:**
> If you don't have either Node or Npm installed, do so using the [official node.js installer](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

### Installation
Install the AsyncAPI CLI globally on your computer using the npm command below:
```
npm install -g @asyncapi/cli
```

To install a specific version of the tool, pass the version during installation:
```
npm install -g @asyncapi/generator@{vesrion}
```
#### MacOS
**Using Brew**

For MACOS users you can install the CLI using the brew command below:
```
# Install brew 
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
# Install AsyncAPI CLI
brew install asyncapi
```
**Using pkg**
Each release of CLI produces a MacOS dedicated pkg file that enables you to install this CLI as MacOS application.
```
# Download latest release. To download specific release, your link should look similar to https://github.com/asyncapi/cli/releases/download/v0.13.0/asyncapi.pkg. All releases are listed in https://github.com/asyncapi/cli/releases
