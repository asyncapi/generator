## Python WebSocket Client

You can test this template:
1. Clone the project and run `npm install`
2. Navigate to `packages/templates/clients/websocket/python`
3. Install with `npm install` and run test with `npm run test`

4. Install dependencies of the generated client: `pip install -r test/temp/snapshotTestResult/requirements.txt`
5. Start example script that uses a client library generated by the test: `python example.py`

> By default this is testing against Postman echo service. You can modify `packages/templates/clients/websocket/python/example.py` and change first line to `from test.temp.snapshotTestResult.client_hoppscotch import HoppscotchEchoWebSocketClient` and line 16 `client = HoppscotchEchoWebSocketClient()` and run `python example.py` again. You will see example still works but against different API. This is possible as both AsyncAPI documents have the same name of operation for sending messages: `sendEchoMessage` so each client generated has the same API.
