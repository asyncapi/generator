## Dart WebSocket Client

You can test this template:
1. Clone the project and run `npm install`
2. Navigate to `packages/templates/clients/websocket/test/integration-test` and run the tests with `npm run test` to generate WebSocket clients
3. Navigate to `packages/templates/clients/websocket/dart`
4. Install with `npm install` and run test with `npm run test`
5. Navigate to the generated Hoppscotch client folder with `cd test/temp/snapshotTestResult/custom_client_hoppscotch`
6. Install dependencies of the generated client: `dart pub get`
7. Start an example script that uses a client library generated by the test: `dart run --packages=.dart_tool/package_config.json ../../../../example.dart`

> By default, this is testing against Hoppscotch Echo service. You can modify `packages/templates/clients/websocket/dart/example.dart` and change first line to `import 'test/temp/snapshotTestResult/client_postman/client.dart';` and line 15 `final wsClient = PostmanEchoWebSocketClientClient();` and run `dart run --packages=.dart_tool/package_config.json ../../../../example.dart` again. You will see the example still works but against a different API. This is possible as both AsyncAPI documents have the same name of operation for sending messages: `sendEchoMessage` so each client generated has the same API.
