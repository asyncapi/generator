## Parser

The **AsyncAPI Parser** is a powerful library for parsing and validating [AsyncAPI documents](asyncapi-document) in both Node.js and browser environments. It supports YAML and JSON inputs and ensures correctness through schema validation.

### âœ… Supported schema formats:

- AsyncAPI (v2 and v3)
- OpenAPI
- JSON Schema
- Avro
- RAML

These schemas are automatically transformed into JSON Schema format internally, simplifying access and manipulation.

---

## Key Features

- **Parsing** of AsyncAPI YAML/JSON files.
- **Validation** against AsyncAPI and referenced schemas.
- **Dereferencing** of `$ref` values into inlined content.
- **Helper functions** to access channels, messages, schemas, and more.

## Example: AsyncAPI v3 Document

Below is a minimal v3.0.0-compliant AsyncAPI document using `channels`, `operations`, and component references:

```yaml
asyncapi: 3.0.0
info:
  title: Comments Service
