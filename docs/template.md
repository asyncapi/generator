## What's a Template?

Template is a project designed to give you some form of output with the help of Generator and [AsyncAPI file](asyncapi-file.md) as an input. It is just a set of files where you describe what you would like the Generator to generate as an output. Some examples of these outputs can be things such as—code, documentation, diagrams, python and java applications, and much more.
