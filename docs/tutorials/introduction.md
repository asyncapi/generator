## Overview

Generator is a tool that you can use to generate whatever you want basing on the AsyncAPI specification file as an input.

To specify what exactly must be generated you create so called template. To create your own template, go to section that explains [How to create a template](https://github.com/asyncapi/generator#how-to-create-a-template).

There is a large number of templates that are ready to use and are officially supported by the AsyncAPI Initiative.
