Start deprecating `ag` in the generator repository. The purpose of deprecating the `ag` option for documentation generation is to move people's
attention to use the `AsyncAPI CLI` in order to maintain a single entry point for all the AsyncAPI tools. 
Otherwise, the maintainers need to manually update the `ag` option in the generator repository every time a new version of the `AsyncAPI CLI` is released.
