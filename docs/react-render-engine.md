[React](https://reactjs.org) is the render engine that we strongly suggest you should use for any new templates. The only reason it is not the default render engine is to stay backward compatible.

* It enables the possibility of [debugging](#debugging-react-template) your template (this is not possible with Nunjucks).
* It provides better error stack traces.
* Provides better support for separating code into more manageable chunks/components.
* The readability of the template is much better compared to Nunjucks syntax.
* Better tool support for development.
* Introduces testability of components which is not possible with Nunjucks.

When writing React templates you decide whether to use CommonJS, ES5, or ES6 modules since everything is bundled together before the rendering process takes over. We use our own React renderer which can be found in the [Generator React SDK](https://github.com/asyncapi/generator-react-sdk). 
There you can find information about how the renderer works or how we transpile your template files.

Your React template always require `@asyncapi/generator-react-sdk` as a dependency. `@asyncapi/generator-react-sdk` is required to access the `File` component which is required as a root component for a file to be rendered. Furthermore it provides some common components to make your development easier, like `Text` or `Indent`.

Let's consider a basic React template as the one below called `MyTemplate.js`:

```js
import { File, Text } from "@asyncapi/generator-react-sdk";

export default function({ asyncapi, params, originalAsyncAPI }) {
  return (
    <File name="asyncapi.md">
      <Text>Some text that should render as is</Text>
    </File>
  );
}
```

The exported default function returns a `File` component as a root component which the [Generator](https://github.com/asyncapi/generator) uses to figure out what file should be generated. In our case we overwrite the default functionality of saving the file as `MyTemplate.js` but instead use the filename `asyncapi.md`. It is then specified that we should render `Some text that should render as is\n` within that file. Notice the `\n` character at the end, this is something that is automatically added after the `Text` component. 

For further information about components, props etc. see the [Generator React SDK](https://github.com/asyncapi/generator-react-sdk)

### Common assumptions

1. Generator renders all files located in the `template` directory if they meet the following conditions:
    - `File` is the root component
    - The file is not in the list of `nonRenderableFiles` in the template configuration
1. New lines are automatically added after each `Text` component.
1. The props you have access to in rendering function is:
   - `asyncapi` that is a parsed spec file object. Read the [API](https://github.com/asyncapi/parser-js/blob/master/API.md#AsyncAPIDocument) of the Parser to understand what structure you have access to in this parameter.
   - `originalAsyncAPI` that is an original spec file before it is parsed. 
   - `params` that contain the parameters provided when generating.
1. All the file templates are supported where the variables are provided after the default props as listed above. 

### Debugging React template in VSCode

With React, it enables you to debug your templates. For Visual Studio Code, we have created a boilerplate [launch configuration](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging#_launch-configurations) to enable debug in your template. Add the following launch configuration:

```json
{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "type": "node",
      "request": "launch",
      "name": "Debug template",
      "timeout": 10000,
      "sourceMaps": true,
      "args": [
        "./asyncapi.yml",
        "./template",
        "--output",
        "./output",
        "--install",
        "--force-write"
      ],
      "program": "ag"
    }
  ]
}
```

Now replace `./asyncapi.yml` with your document of choice. Replace `./template` with the path to your React template. You can now debug your template by adding any breakpoints you want and inspect your code.
