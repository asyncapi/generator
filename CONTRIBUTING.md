## Overview

Contributions are more than welcome. If you want to contribute, please make sure you go through the following steps:

1. Pick or create an issue. 
    - It's always a good idea to leave a message saying that you're going to work on it before you start any actual work.
    - Consider contacting us on [slack](https://www.asyncapi.com/slack-invite/) to discuss the topic first
2. Fork the repository and work there.
3. Open a Pull Request pointing to the `master` branch.
4. A maintainer will review and, eventually, merge your Pull Request. Please, be patient as most of us are doing this in our spare time.
