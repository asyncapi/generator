## JavaScript WebSocket Client

You can test this template:
1. Clone the project and run `npm install`
2. Navigate to `packages/templates/clients/js/websocket`
3. Install with `npm install` and run test with `npm run test`
4. Start example script that uses a client library generated by the test: `node example.js`

> By default this is testing against Postman echo service. You can modify `packages/templates/clients/js/websocket/example.js` and change first line to `const WSClient = require('./test/temp/snapshotTestResult/client-hoppscotch.js');` and run `node example.js` again. You will see example still works but agains different API. This is possible as both AsyncAPI documents have the same name of operation for sending messages: `sendEchoMessage` so each client generated has the same API.
