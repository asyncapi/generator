## JavaScript WebSocket Client

You can test this template:
1. Clone the project and run `npm install`
2. Navigate to `packages/templates/clients/websocket/test/integration-test` and run the tests with `npm run test` to generate WebSocket clients
3. Navigate to `packages/templates/clients/websocket/javascript`
4. Install with `npm install` and run test with `npm run test`
5. Start example script that uses a client library generated by the test: `node example.js`

> By default this is testing against Hoppscotch echo service. You can modify `packages/templates/clients/websocket/javascript/example.js` and change first line to `const WSClient = require('./tests/temp/snapshotTestResult/client_postman/client.js');` and run `node example.js` again. You will see example still works but now it is using a different API. This is possible since both AsyncAPI documents define the same name of operation for sending messages: `sendEchoMessage` so each client generated has the same API.
